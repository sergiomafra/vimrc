# vimrc
Those are my .vimrc files

##.vimrc.base
This one was my first .vimrc file that I copied mostly from an article.

##.vimrc.simplified
Focused only on Python programming with no Plugins installed. Very light weight.

##.vimrc.current
This is the .vimrc that I'm currently using. Has some Plugins for Python, HTML and JavaScript as well as an autocomplete one.
